**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

My code was written according to best practices. I wrote small sections and then tested as I went to ensure that my code was technically sound. My code will be reusable for several other projects in the future. I wrote my code to be efficient by using a minimalist design, indented so my code is easy to read. Lastly, my code was commented so that any other programmer in the future will understand what is going on in the code. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

**How do I approach designing software?**
